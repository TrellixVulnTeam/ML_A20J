	-->conda create --prefix ./env pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
	now the output was
	# To activate this environment, use
	#
	#     $ conda activate /Users/somyajaiswal/Desktop/Machine_Learning/Test/env
	#
	# To deactivate an active environment, use
	#
	#     $ conda deactivate

	normal installiation
	 -->conda install jupyter

2) To Check you are on which environment do 
	--> conda env lisk

3) To start jupyter notebook 
	--> jupyter notebook


	IF Plots dont show up then 
	inside jupyter notebook
		--> %matplotlib inline
		--> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

To run any terminal command on the jupyter notebook we use bang operator eg:- !ls

To install any packages from jupyter notebook to the conda environment use
